This is the XDoclet plugin for Maven (http://jakarta.apache.org/maven/)
It will be packaged as a jar file that can be dropped in Maven's plugin dir.
The plugin.jelly script is not in CVS, as it will be generated by XDoclet
when invoking ant in the directory where this file is located.
N.B. XDoclet should be built first. See general build instructions for XDoclet.
