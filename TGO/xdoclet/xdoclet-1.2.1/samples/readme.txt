The samples illustrate the use of XDoclet. The source code contains @tag
declarations, the build.xml file the build process (use Jakarta Ant 1.5 or higher).

Running build.xml using Ant runs ejbdoclet and webdoclet so the deployment
descriptors and EJB-related classes and interfaces are generated, WAR, EJB-JAR
and EAR files created.

The build.xml shows a typical build process with XDoclet tasks in it. You can
use it as a template for build.xml file of your own project.

Instructions for end users:

- Now run ant, you should see the build process output.

Note that you can run "ant ejbdoclet" to run only the <ejbdoclet/> task which
does the EJB stuff or "ant webdoclet" to run only the <webdoclet/> task which
does the web stuff.

What you get:
 - Generated source files went to target/gen-src directory.
 - Generated deployment descriptors went to the corresponding directory under
   the target/meta-inf or target/web-inf directories.

Note:
By default <ejbdoclet/> will generate EJB 2.0 compatible output. If you are
using a 1.1 compatible application server you may want to tell <ejbdoclet/>
to generate 1.1 compatible output. To do this edit build.xml and set
ejbspec="1.1" for the <ejbdoclet/> task.

Have Fun!
The XDoclet Team.
